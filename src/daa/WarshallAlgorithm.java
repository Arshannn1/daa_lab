//Here's a summary of how the diagonal elements are set in these algorithms:
//
//Warshall's Algorithm (for transitive closure): Diagonal elements should be 1 because itâ€™s about reachability. Every vertex is reachable from itself.
//
//Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (for shortest paths): Diagonal elements should be 0 because the shortest distance from a vertex to itself is zero.
